The following repository contains an implementation of the standard Lanczos Algorithm in `src/lanczos.py`, as well as a notebook `lanczos.ipynb` containing an example use-case. For more information regarding the algorithm itself, visit [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm).

## Installation

To import and run the algorithm, `git clone` the repository onto your local machine, and assuming your code instance is contained within the cloned repo, import the module like so:
```
from src.lanczos import lanczos
```
Then, you should be able to call the function like you would any other. See `lanczos.ipynb` for an example.
